# Java-Palindrome-
This is a Java palindrome assignment we had to complete for a second-year module to cover the fundamentals of Java.

##<h2> Description of Palindrome 
A palindrome is a phrase or sequence that reads the same backwards. In this instance, I created a public method that captures the remainder as an integer.
A reverse method is used to capture the string input as the "palindrome". Then two boolean methods are created to check if the number or word entered is a 
palindrome or not. The main method is used as the user interface whereby the user decides on whether to test a word or number as a palindrome and then the 
user input. The methods used are then called to show the user the output of what they entered in terms of the input being a palindrome or not.
